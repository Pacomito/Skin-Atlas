Within the skin are various immune cells that protect us from pathogens. Yet sometime, skin diseases arise from deregulations in T cells which are also strongly influenced by all other immune cells present in the skin.\n\nMultiplex imaging technology provides unprecedented access to the spatial organization and protein expression of single cells within the skin. This powerful tool allows us to better characterize different immune diseases, particularly distinguishing between benign conditions like Psoriasis and Eczema, and malignant conditions such as Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) which can be life-threatening.\n\nTo achieve this, we collected several skin biopsies from patients with various skin diseases and employed multiplex imaging to map their protein landscapes. \n\nGet ready for the tour !\n\nImage adapted from \"T cells and the skin: from protective immunity to inflammatory skin disorders\", Ho and Kupper, Nat.
